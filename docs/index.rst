Welcome to retico-core's documentation!
=======================================

retico-core is the part of the retico framework that provides the core definitions and
functionality. In this repository, the abstract classes for incremental modules,
incremental units (IUs), queues, update messages, and more are defined. Also, basic
modules and IUs for transmitting and processing audio, text, dialogue acts are provided.

This documentation gives an overview over the architecture of retico and describes the
general functionality of incremental modules and units. Also, it explains the necessary
steps to install the package and how to use it.
